## S-Docs Coding Challenge - Stage 2
You have made the page and controller, and the clients love it! However, they have a few requests for some features to be added. In the email sent to you, you have been tasked with implementing a certain number of these tasks into your new page/controller. Besides given restrictions, you may complete these tasks in any way you see fit:

1.) If the specified Account's field Ownership is set to "Public", they want to show the Employees field in the Account Info pageBlock. If it is not, then they don't want to show this field.
- NOTE: This implementation MUST use only Visualforce for this. No Javascript or Backend Apex.

2.) They would like the ability to edit the Amount field of Related Opportunity records (in bulk fashion)

3.) They would like added support for a filter on the Name field in Other Opportunities
- The filter should just allow a user to type in a string and then only show any Opportunity records in the table for which the name includes that string.

4.)  They would like a button added to each Other Opportunity which when pressed loads that particular Opportunity's linked Account record into the Account info section. It should also refresh the Related Opportunities and Other Opportunities tables accordingly for this new Account record.
- This can be added between the Checkbox and the Name field
